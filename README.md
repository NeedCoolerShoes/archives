# NeedCoolerShoes Archive

This repository is an archive for all things related to https://needcoolershoes.com.

Currently, it only holds archives of the public skins, but stuff like old editors and such may be moved here in the future.

## Skins

Skin archives are located in /skins. Each archive holds the date range of the skins in the file name.

Skin archives are stored in the .zip format.

Inside each archive zip, there is a metadata.jsonl. It includes metadata about the skin such as author, license and description.

Only skins public to the gallery are archived.
